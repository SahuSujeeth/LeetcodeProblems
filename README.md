# LeetCode Solutions â€“ Day 1

## ðŸ§© Problem 1: Two Sum

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.  
Each input has exactly one solution, and the same element cannot be used twice.

---

### Sample Input / Output
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9  
Output: [0,1]

# LeetCode Solutions â€“ Day 2

## ðŸ§© Problem 9: Palindrome Number  

### Problem Statement  
Given an integer `x`, return **true** if `x` is a palindrome, and **false** otherwise.  
A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward.  

---

### Sample Input / Output  
**Input:** x = 121  
**Output:** true  

**Input:** x = -121  
**Output:** false  

**Input:** x = 10  
**Output:** false

# ðŸ“˜ Day 3 â€“ Roman to Integer

### Problem Statement  
Convert a Roman numeral into an integer.  
Roman numerals are represented by seven symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.  

For example:  
- II â†’ 2  
- IV â†’ 4  
- IX â†’ 9  
- LVIII â†’ 58  
- MCMXCIV â†’ 1994  

---

### Approach  
1. Create a map of Roman symbols to their integer values.  
2. Traverse the string from left to right.  
3. If the current value is less than the next value, subtract it. Otherwise, add it.  

---

### Output (Sample)  
- II â†’ 2  
- IV â†’ 4  
- IX â†’ 9  
- LVIII â†’ 58  
- MCMXCIV â†’ 1994

### Difficulty

# ðŸ“˜ Day 4 â€“ Longest Common Prefix

### Problem Statement  
Write a function to find the **longest common prefix string** amongst an array of strings.  
If there is no common prefix, return an empty string `""`.  

---


### Output (Sample)    
- Input: `["flower","flow","flight"]`  
  Output: `"fl"`  

- Input: `["dog","racecar","car"]`  
  Output: `""`  

---

### Approach  
1. Take the first string as a prefix.  
2. Compare it with each string in the array.  
3. If the string doesnâ€™t start with the prefix, keep shortening the prefix.  
4. Return the final prefix.

## Day 5 - Valid Parentheses
Problem Statement

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Examples
Input:` s = "()"`
Output:` true`

Input: `s = "()[]{}"`
Output: `true`

Input: `s = "(]"`
Output: `false`

Input: `s = "([])"`
Output:`true`

Input: `s = "([)]"`
Output: `false`


## Approach

Use a stack to track opening brackets.
Iterate over the string:
If the character is an opening bracket '(', '{', '[', push it to the stack.
If it is a closing bracket, check the top of the stack:
If it matches, pop the top.
Otherwise, return false.
At the end, if the stack is empty, return true.
Why Stack?

Stack ensures Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order, which perfectly matches nested bracket structures.

 ## Complexity
Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ each character is processed once.
Space Complexity: O(n) â€“ in the worst case, all opening brackets are stored in the stack

## Difficulty
- Easy.
